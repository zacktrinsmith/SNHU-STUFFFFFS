# SNHU-STUFFFFFS

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. Made 2 clocks that could add seconds, minutes & hours.
    
    What did you do particularly well? I believe I annotated and commented pretty effectively on this particular program.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? There is no security in the code, 
    it's just generic functions that tie together to create a "clock", if this were a legit company, I would definitely want to advance the interface and 
    security of the code.
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? I found that writing the main function call loop was 
    the most difficult. 
    
    What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? Definitely saving the user input code portion, and output of adding to seconds, minutes and hours.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? All of it? This program made me use standardized coding methods
    to hone in my skills to make a clock, it doesn't get much better than that.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Utilized standardized coding practices, comments, and integration of layering multiple
    sections of code to make this final product easily accessible, updated, and adaptable for any clock based needs.
